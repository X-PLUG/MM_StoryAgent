# MM-StoryAgent
This repo is the official implementation of "MM-StoryAgent: Immersive Narrated Storybook Video Generation with a Multi-Agent Paradigm across Text, Image and Audio".

## Introduction
MM-StoryAgent is a multi-agent framework that employs LLMs and diverse expert tools across several modalities to produce expressive storytelling videos. It hightlights in the following aspects:
* MM-StoryAgent designs a reliable and **customizable** workflow. Users can define their own expert tools to improve the generation quality of each component.
* MM-StoryAgent writes **high-quality** stories based on the input story setting, in a multi-agent, multi-stage pipeline.
* Agents of all modalities (image, speech, sound, music) generated corresponding assets are composed to an **immersive** storytelling video.

## Installation
Install the required dependencies and install this repo as a package:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart
MM-StoryAgent can be called by configuration files:
```bash
python run.py -c configs/mm_story_agent.yaml
```
Each agent is called in the following format:
```yaml
story_writer: # agent name
    tool: qa_outline_story_writer # name registered in the definition
    cfg: # parameters for initializing the agent instance
        max_conv_turns: 3
        ...
    params: # parameters for calling the agent instance
        story_topic: "Time Management: A child learning how to manage their time effectively."
        ...
```
The customization of new agents can refer to [music_agent.py](mm_story_agent/modality_agents/music_agent.py#L42). The agent class should implement `__init__` and `call` to work properly, like the following:
```python
from typing import Dict
from mm_story_agent.base import register_tool

@register_tool("my_speech_agent")
class MySpeechAgent:
    
    def __init__(self, cfg: Dict):
        # For example, the agent need `attr1` and `attr2` for initilization
        self.attr1 = cfg.attr1
        self.attr2 = cfg.attr2
        ...
    
    def call(self, params: Dict):
        # For example, calling the agent needs `voice` and `speed` parameters
        voice = params["voice"]
        speed = params["speed"]
        ...
    
```
Then the agent can be called by simply modifying the configuration like:
```yaml
speech_generation:
    tool: my_speech_agent
    cfg:
        attr1: val1
        attr2: val2
    params:
        voice: en_female
        speed: 1.0
```

## Evaluation Data
The evaluation topics are provided in [story_topics.json](story_eval/story_topics.json). Evaluation rubrics and prompts are also provided accordingly.

### Story Content Evaluation
We use GPT-4 to automatically evaluate the story quality according to several aspects.
Our story writing agent is compared with directly prompting LLM to write stories.
Evaluation scores show the advantage of our multi-agent, multi-stage story writing pipeline.
